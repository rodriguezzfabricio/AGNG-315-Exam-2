Aging of Cardiovascular System


How your digestive system works - Emma Bryce : 

0:06
Across the whole planet,
0:07
humans eat on average between one and 2.7 kilograms of food a day.
0:13
That's over 365 kilograms a year per person,
0:17
and more than 28,800 kilograms over the course of a lifetime.
0:23
And every last scrap makes its way through the digestive system.
0:27
Comprised of ten organs covering nine meters,
0:30
and containing over 20 specialized cell types,
0:33
this is one of the most diverse and complicated systems in the human body.
0:38
Its parts continuously work in unison to fulfill a singular task:
0:42
transforming the raw materials of your food
0:45
into the nutrients and energy that keep you alive.
0:48
Spanning the entire length of your torso,
0:51
the digestive system has four main components.
0:54
First, there's the gastrointestinal tract,
0:57
a twisting channel that transports your food
0:59
and has an internal surface area of between 30 and 40 square meters,
1:05
enough to cover half a badminton court.
1:08
Second, there's the pancreas,
1:09
gallbladder,
1:10
and liver,
1:11
a trio of organs that break down food using an array of special juices.
1:16
Third, the body's enzymes,
1:18
hormones,
1:19
nerves,
1:19
and blood
1:20
all work together to break down food,
1:23
modulate the digestive process,
1:25
and deliver its final products.
1:27
Finally, there's the mesentery,
1:29
a large stretch of tissue that supports
1:32
and positions all your digestive organs in the abdomen,
1:35
enabling them to do their jobs.
1:37
The digestive process begins before food even hits your tongue.
1:42
Anticipating a tasty morsel,
1:44
glands in your mouth start to pump out saliva.
1:47
We produce about 1.5 liters of this liquid each day.
1:52
Once inside your mouth,
1:53
chewing combines with the sloshing saliva
1:56
to turn food into a moist lump called the bolus.
2:00
Enzymes present in the saliva break down any starch.
2:04
Then, your food finds itself
2:06
at the rim of a 25-centimeter-long tube called the esophagus,
2:10
down which it must plunge to reach the stomach.
2:14
Nerves in the surrounding esophageal tissue
2:16
sense the bolus's presence and trigger peristalsis,
2:20
a series of defined muscular contractions.
2:23
That propels the food into the stomach,
2:25
where it's left at the mercy of the muscular stomach walls,
2:29
which bound the bolus, breaking it into chunks.
2:32
Hormones, secreted by cells in the lining, trigger the release of acids
2:37
and enzyme-rich juices from the stomach wall
2:39
that start to dissolve the food and break down its proteins.
2:43
These hormones also alert the pancreas,
2:45
liver,
2:46
and gallbladder
2:47
to produce digestive juices
2:49
and transfer bile, a yellowish-green liquid that digests fat,
2:53
in preparation for the next stage.
2:56
After three hours inside the stomach,
2:58
the once shapely bolus is now a frothy liquid called chyme,
3:02
and it's ready to move into the small intestine.
3:05
The liver sends bile to the gallbladder,
3:08
which secretes it into the first portion of the small intestine called the duodenum.
3:14
Here, it dissolves the fats floating in the slurry of chyme
3:17
so they can be easily digested by the pancreatic and intestinal juices
3:22
that have leached onto the scene.
3:24
These enzyme-rich juices break the fat molecules down into fatty acids
3:29
and glycerol for easier absorption into the body.
3:33
The enzymes also carry out the final deconstruction
3:35
of proteins into amino acids
3:38
and carbohydrates into glucose.
3:40
This happens in the small intestine's lower regions,
3:43
the jejunum and ileum,
3:45
which are coated in millions of tiny projections called villi.
3:49
These create a huge surface area to maximize molecule absorption
3:54
and transference into the blood stream.
3:56
The blood takes them on the final leg of their journey
3:59
to feed the body's organs and tissues.
4:02
But it's not over quite yet.
4:04
Leftover fiber,
4:05
water,
4:06
and dead cells sloughed off during digestion
4:09
make it into the large intestine, also known as the colon.
4:13
The body drains out most of the remaining fluid through the intestinal wall.
4:17
What's left is a soft mass called stool.
4:20
The colon squeezes this byproduct into a pouch called the rectum,
4:24
where nerves sense it expanding
4:26
and tell the body when it's time to expel the waste.
4:29
The byproducts of digestion exit through the anus
4:32
and the food's long journey,
4:33
typically lasting between 30 and 40 hours,
4:36
is finally complete.

BYU Nursing Gerontology (2018). Aging changes of the cells, respiratory system, and the cardiovascular system :


0:00
in this video we will discuss the aging
0:04
changes that you may encounter in the
0:05
cells the respiratory system in the
0:08
cardiovascular system this video will
0:11
provide an overview of Aging in these
0:13
three systems for more details you will
0:15
want to refer to your textbook as we age
0:21
the total number of functional
0:23
functional cells on our body will
0:25
decrease muscle and bone mass will
0:28
decrease and this will lead to a
0:30
decrease also in lean body mass with
0:34
this decrease in lean body mass will
0:37
come an increase proportional amount of
0:39
fat within our bodies with the decrease
0:41
in lean body mass we will also
0:43
experience a decrease in total body
0:45
water this in turn will make older
0:47
adults much more susceptible to
0:49
dehydration many aging changes occur to
0:56
our respiratory system changes to the
0:59
connective tissue of the nose leads to a
1:01
tipping of the nose downward older
1:05
adults are also more likely to breathe
1:07
through their mouths which may
1:09
contribute to snoring and possibly
1:13
obstructive sleep apnea the mucus in the
1:16
nose of older adults becomes more dry
1:18
leading to the feeling of continual
1:21
nasal stuffiness in terms of the chest
1:27
itself the ribs and tissues within the
1:29
lungs become more rigid making it
1:32
difficult for them to expand and
1:33
contract as they did when they were
1:35
younger the cilia become less effective
1:39
in removing mucus and bacteria from the
1:41
lungs older adults also experience a
1:44
decrease in the total number of alveoli
1:47
within the lungs themselves overall the
1:50
lungs become smaller less firm lighter
1:53
and more rigid all of these things
1:56
together make it more difficult to get
1:58
air in and out of the lungs leading to
2:01
increased residual volumes and decreased
2:04
lung capacity these things also place
2:08
older adults at higher risk for the
2:10
develop for the development of rest
2:12
taury infections such as pneumonia let's
2:18
now take a look at the cardiovascular
2:20
system we will discuss the changes in
2:23
the anatomy and physiology of the heart
2:25
as well as the blood vessels throughout
2:27
the body in terms of anatomy we do not
2:30
need to see we do not see any
2:32
significant changes in the overall size
2:34
of the size of the heart this being said
2:37
we do however see a slight increase in
2:40
the size of the left ventricle the
2:43
atrioventricular valves called the
2:45
mitral and tricuspid valves tend to
2:48
become thicker and more rigid which in
2:51
turn may lead to incomplete valve
2:52
closure and the presence of both
2:54
systolic and diastolic murmurs if these
2:58
valves become too thick and rigid it may
3:01
lead to future health to future heart
3:03
failure as the heart needs to pump with
3:06
more force to get the blood out to the
3:08
body in terms of vessels the aorta tends
3:11
to become dilated and elongated as we
3:14
age let's look at the changes in the
3:22
physiology of the cardiovascular system
3:23
with aging in order to understand the
3:26
physiology it is important to understand
3:28
a few key terms the first is that of
3:31
cardiac output cardiac output is the
3:35
volume of blood the heart is able to
3:37
pump from the left ventricle to the body
3:39
every minute the cardiac output is
3:41
determined by the heart rate and the
3:44
stroke volume the stroke volume is the
3:48
volume of blood pumped out with each
3:50
beat looking at this diagram we also see
3:54
several factors affecting the heart rate
3:56
as well as several factors affecting the
3:58
stroke volume we've already discussed
4:01
that the overall size of the heart does
4:03
not increase with age but we do have a
4:06
slight increase in the size of the left
4:09
ventricle we do experience a change in
4:13
the contractility of the heart this
4:16
decreases the ability of the left
4:18
ventricle to contract leading to a
4:20
slightly decreased stroke volume
4:22
it also will take longer for the
4:24
ventricle to fill
4:25
empty this decrease in contractility or
4:28
in other terms the strength of
4:30
contraction leads to a decrease in
4:32
overall cardiac output this is not
4:35
normally problematic unless the patient
4:37
is under stress such as when doing
4:40
increased physical activity continuing
4:43
to exercise throughout your lifetime
4:44
will diminish the negative effects
4:47
significantly this diagram depicts the
4:54
conduction pathway of the heart as we
4:57
age the pacemaker cells which carry
5:00
electrical impulses throughout the heart
5:02
decrease in number and become more
5:04
irregular this may lead to increased
5:06
myocardial irritability and an increased
5:09
likelihood of the development of
5:11
arrhythmias here is an example of what
5:18
an arrhythmia may look like on an EKG
5:20
the top tracing is normal whereas the
5:23
bottom is an arrhythmia termed atrial
5:26
fibrillation it would not I would not
5:29
classify atrial fibrillation as a normal
5:31
finding in an older adult yet it does
5:33
happen quite commonly as we age our
5:41
blood vessels tend to become more rigid
5:43
and apt to develop atherosclerosis as
5:46
you can see in this diagram a natheless
5:48
atherosclerosis 'el is significantly
5:51
more narrow than a normal healthy artery
5:54
this places older adults at risk for the
5:57
development of heart attacks and strokes
5:59
with the increased rigidity of the
6:02
vessels older adults are also more
6:04
likely to develop chronic hypertension
6:09
in addition to our blood vessels we also
6:13
have what are called baroreceptors these
6:16
baroreceptors sense changes in blood
6:18
pressure and then signal the body to
6:20
either contract or relax the blood
6:22
vessels depending on the ball on the
6:24
body's needs in older adults these
6:27
receptors do not respond as quickly as
6:29
they would in a younger person this
6:32
leads to the possibility of the
6:33
development of postural hypotension for
6:36
example when you go from a sitting to a
6:38
standing
6:39
position our baroreceptors use this
6:42
excuse me our baroreceptors sense this
6:45
and cause our vessels to contract in
6:47
order to keep our blood pressure high
6:49
enough for blood to travel to the brain
6:51
in an older adult these receptors may be
6:54
slow to respond leading to a significant
6:56
decrease in blood pressure and blood to
6:59
the brain this could this could lead to
7:02
dizziness and falls in the older adult
7:04
it is for this reason that we should
7:06
always encourage older adults to sit
7:08
before they stand and then to stand
7:11
slowly this concludes our video lecture
7:15
on the cells the respiratory system and
7:17
the cardiovascular system

 Aging of the Respiratory System

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Symptoms, History, and More | Mass General Brigham:

Intro
0:00
there are 15 million people in the u.s
0:02
diagnosed with copd and probably another
0:04
15 million who have copd but haven't
0:06
been diagnosed yet hi i'm dr craig
0:09
hirsch a lung specialist at brigham and
0:11
women's hospital and an associate
0:13
professor of medicine at harvard medical
0:15
school and this is clues to cures a
0:17
history of a cure for chronic
0:19
obstructive pulmonary disease or copd
0:22
copd stands for chronic obstructive
What is COPD
0:25
pulmonary disease it's a group of
0:26
conditions that cause difficulty
0:28
breathing this includes emphysema which
0:31
is destruction of the lung tissue and
0:33
chronic bronchitis which is inflammation
0:35
of the airways causing cough and phlegm
Cause & Symptoms for COPD
0:38
in the u.s and the developed world copd
0:41
is mostly caused by cigarette smoking
0:42
copd can be dangerous for a number of
0:44
reasons the main symptoms are shortness
0:47
of breath cough and phlegm which can be
0:50
troublesome to patients on a day-to-day
0:52
basis as the disease progresses it can
0:54
get more severe with declining lung
0:56
function and people require oxygen on a
0:59
daily basis to get around people with
1:01
copd can also get flare-ups called
1:04
exacerbations like a bad bronchitis that
1:06
may require treatment either as an
1:08
outpatient or the emergency room or the
1:10
hospital one of the earliest
History of COPD
1:12
descriptions of emphysema was in 1821 by
1:16
renee lanak the inventor of the
1:17
stethoscope a tool we still use to
1:19
diagnose copd and other lung diseases
1:22
copd was not common in his time since
1:25
smoking was uncommon he described a
1:27
cough with heavy mucus accompanied by
1:29
difficult respiration although he did
1:31
not make the connection between copd and
1:33
smoking his description of the symptoms
1:35
are still relevant today
1:38
however currently we have treatments so
1:40
the disease doesn't have to be so
1:41
debilitating and fatal
Treatment Advancements in COPD
1:44
we've come a long way since 1821. over
1:46
the past 20 years or so there have been
1:48
many advances in the treatment many of
1:50
them are inhalers which help improve the
1:52
day-to-day symptoms of shortness of
1:54
breath and cough there are also
1:56
medicines in pill form which reduce the
1:58
risk of exacerbations the flare-ups that
2:00
we discussed before so one of the things
2:02
that happens in emphysema is the lungs
2:04
get too big for the chest making it
2:06
difficult to breathe especially when
2:08
walking around in the past decades a
2:10
surgery has been developed called lung
2:12
volume reduction surgery which reduces
2:14
the size of the lungs to help them fit
2:16
better in the chest and ease breathing
2:18
in recent years a device has been
2:20
developed called endobronchial valves
2:22
the one-way valves are placed into the
2:24
lungs and cause collapse of the lung
2:26
behind it allowing the lungs to fit
2:28
better into the chest without the
2:30
surgery
2:32
over the past 20 or 30 years lung
2:34
transplant the most extreme surgery for
2:36
copd has been continually improving
COPD Conditions
2:39
copd includes several different
2:41
conditions some of the research at mass
2:42
general brigham is trying to figure out
2:44
what those different types of copd are
2:46
and how we can give people a more
2:48
personalized treatment so we have tools
2:50
that help study how to diagnose and find
2:52
better ways to treat copd patients one
2:55
is a ct scan of the lungs which gives us
2:58
detailed 3d images of the lungs the
3:01
other is a lung function test which
3:03
monitors lung conditions by measuring
3:05
how much air you can breathe out in a
3:07
forced breath the goal of both of these
3:09
tests is to target the right drugs to
3:11
the right patient to give them the most
3:13
benefit we've come a long way in the
3:15
past 20 years but there's still plenty
3:16
of room to grow
3:18

    Why are the kidneys important?
    How do my kidneys work?
    How does blood flow through my kidneys?
    Clinical Trials

The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of your spine.

Healthy kidneys filter about a half cup of blood every minute, removing wastes and extra water to make urine. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through two thin tubes of muscle called ureters, one on each side of your bladder. Your bladder stores urine. Your kidneys, ureters, and bladder are part of your urinary tract.
The urinary tract, showing the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra.You have two kidneys that filter your blood, removing wastes and extra water to make urine.
Why are the kidneys important?

Your kidneys remove wastes and extra fluid from your body. Your kidneys also remove acid that is produced by the cells of your body and maintain a healthy balance of water, salts, and minerals—such as sodium, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium—in your blood.

Without this balance, nerves, muscles, and other tissues in your body may not work normally.

Your kidneys also make hormones that help

    control your blood pressure
    make red blood cells NIH external link
    keep your bones strong and healthy

Watch a video about what the kidneys do External link.
How do my kidneys work?

Each of your kidneys is made up of about a million filtering units called nephrons. Each nephron includes a filter, called the glomerulus, and a tubule. The nephrons work through a two-step process: the glomerulus filters your blood, and the tubule returns needed substances to your blood and removes wastes.
Drawing of a nephron showing that a blood vessel from the renal artery leads to the glomerulus before branching across the u-shaped tubule and leading to the renal vein.Each nephron has a glomerulus to filter your blood and a tubule that returns needed substances to your blood and pulls out additional wastes. Wastes and extra water become urine.
The glomerulus filters your blood

As blood flows into each nephron, it enters a cluster of tiny blood vessels—the glomerulus. The thin walls of the glomerulus allow smaller molecules, wastes, and fluid—mostly water—to pass into the tubule. Larger molecules, such as proteins and blood cells, stay in the blood vessel.
The tubule returns needed substances to your blood and removes wastes

A blood vessel runs alongside the tubule. As the filtered fluid moves along the tubule, the blood vessel reabsorbs almost all of the water, along with minerals and nutrients your body needs. The tubule helps remove excess acid from the blood. The remaining fluid and wastes in the tubule become urine.
How does blood flow through my kidneys?

Blood flows into your kidney through the renal artery. This large blood vessel branches into smaller and smaller blood vessels until the blood reaches the nephrons. In the nephron, your blood is filtered by the tiny blood vessels of the glomeruli and then flows out of your kidney through the renal vein.

Your blood circulates through your kidneys many times a day. In a single day, your kidneys filter about 150 quarts of blood. Most of the water and other substances that filter through your glomeruli are returned to your blood by the tubules. Only 1 to 2 quarts become urine. Children produce less urine than adults, and the amount produced depends on their age.
A human kidney, with arrows showing where unfiltered blood enters the kidney and filtered blood leaves the kidney. Wastes and extra water leave the kidney through the ureter to the bladder as urine.Unfiltered blood flows into your kidneys through the renal artery and filtered blood exits through your renal vein. The ureter carries urine from the kidney to your bladder.
Clinical Trials

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions.
What are clinical trials, and are they right for you?

Clinical trials are part of clinical research and at the heart of all medical advances. Clinical trials look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease. Researchers also use clinical trials to look at other aspects of care, such as improving the quality of life for people with chronic illnesses. Find out if clinical trials are right for you NIH external link.
What clinical trials are open?

Clinical trials that are currently open and are recruiting can be viewed at ClinicalTrials.gov NIH external link.

how does your urinary tract
0:10
work your urinary tract is your body's
0:13
drainage system filtering out waste and
0:15
other substances that your body doesn't
0:17
need these toxins and substances leave
0:20
your body in the form of urine going to
0:22
the bathroom requires all parts of the
0:24
urinary tract to work together in the
0:26
correct order so how exactly does your
0:29
urinary tract work anyway let's take a
0:33
look the urinary tract consists of two
0:36
kidneys two uror the bladder and the
0:39
urethra men also have a prostate that
0:42
sits just below the bladder the bladder
0:45
and kidneys are the parts of the body
0:47
that make store and pass
0:50
urine the kidneys are two bean-shaped
0:52
organs about the size of a fist they are
0:55
located just under your rib cage on each
0:58
side of the spine the kidneys filter
1:00
your blood 24 hours a day 365 days a
1:04
year once blood has been filtered
1:06
through your kidneys it reenters
1:08
circulation in your body the excess
1:11
water and toxins extracted from your
1:13
blood make urine then the urur which are
1:16
thin tubes of smooth muscle extending
1:18
from each kidney carry your urine from
1:20
the kidneys to the bladder the bladder
1:23
is a balloon shaped organ located in the
1:26
pelvis between the pelvic bones the
1:29
bladder serves as a storage unit for
1:31
urine it is held in place by pelvic
1:33
muscles in the lower part of your body
1:36
nerve signals in your brain let you know
1:38
that your bladder is getting full then
1:40
you will feel the need to go to the
1:42
bathroom the brain tells your bladder
1:44
muscles to squeeze or contract which
1:46
forces the urine out of your urethra the
1:49
tube that carries urine out of your
1:51
body your urethra has muscles called
1:54
sphincters they help keep the urethra
1:57
closed so that urine doesn't leak out
1:59
before you're ready ready to go to the
2:00
bathroom the sphincters open up when the
2:03
bladder squeezes unlike the rest of your
2:06
urinary tract system this is the part of
2:08
the process that your body can
2:12
control your urinary tract system is
2:15
very important and vital to your overall
2:17
health make sure that you take care of
2:19
your urinary tract system by drinking
2:21
plenty of water to flush out urinary
2:23
waste and toxins using the bathroom when
2:25
the urge arises instead of holding it
2:28
for too long and eating a heal healthy
2:30
diet including fruits vegetables protein
2:32
and whole grains if you are having any
2:35

:

0:00
Aging affects bladder health in a couple
0:02
of ways. There can be a deterioration in
0:05
how the nerves and the muscles signal
0:08
the bladder. In addition, the bladder
0:10
muscle can lose its elasticity or
0:13
stretchiness so that it doesn't want to
0:14
hold as much urine as it did when it was
0:17
younger.
0:20
Other medical conditions can
0:22
significantly contribute to the health
0:25
of the bladder. For example, someone
0:28
that has arthritis may be limited in
0:30
their activity because of the pain. Not
0:33
being active leads to generalized
0:35
deterioration in the muscle strength,
0:38
which can make it harder to go from
0:40
lying to standing or sitting to
0:41
standing. And the longer it takes to
0:43
change position and get to the bathroom
0:45
can interfere with the ability to get to
0:48
the bathroom in time. In addition, heart
0:51
conditions can cause you to retain fluid
0:54
in your body that has to come out often
0:56
times at night when you're lying down.
0:59
And it's not unusual in older people for
1:02
them to make most of their total urine
1:04
output at night. That certainly can make
1:06
it harder to get a good night's sleep
1:08
when you're making so much urine that
1:10
you have to get up frequently to get rid
1:12
of it.
